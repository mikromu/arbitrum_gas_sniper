# Arbitrum Gas Sniper 🔥

Sniffs out transactions paying absurd gas (>5 gwei) on Arbitrum — almost always MEV bots, liquidations, or panic moves.


When you see this fire, something big is happening right now.

### Why run it?
- Spot liquidations before price moves  
- Watch sandwich bots in action  
- Catch panic sells / rage buys live  

```bash
python arbitrum_gas_sniper.py
